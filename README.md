Plant phenotyping is a critical aspect of characterizing plant for plant growth monitoring.This paper introduces an efficient approach to identify healthy and diseasedor an infected leaf using image processing and machine learning techniques. Various diseases damage the chlorophyll of leaves and affect with brown or black marks on the leaf area. These can be detected using image preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification using machine learning algorithms. For feature extraction, Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is applied. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the machine learning algorithms is used for classification. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) resulted in a improved accuracy of recognition compared to the SVM approach.
